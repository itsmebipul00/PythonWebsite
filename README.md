Hello World with Python
==========================

This is a website using Python.  It takes the mosiac project from another repository and tries to make it into a website.
Some worries I'm having are about people who's pictures I'm using to form the mosaics getting angry, but I have found that 
google can filter by license so I'm looking into that. 

I also need to figure out how to let people search without using my api and cx keys, perhaps I should just make them 
get thier own.
